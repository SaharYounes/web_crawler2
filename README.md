# web_crawler2
i want to add two functionalities
OK: 1- make the condition to check for a website's domain before the crawl starts, that way they will be stored but not crawled
OK: 2- finish looping over an object

normilize URL should be in the begning of Crawl page to make sure al invalid URLs reections are handeled by it?
